* What's this
  My P-A-O system following Dominic's System.

* Why
  Reading some books about speed reading, memory athletes, and
  memorizing techniques I started adapting the systems there to my
  personal needs and tastes.

* Where
  https://kidd.github.io/pao

* When
  Developed late 2017

* How
  First is to create your own PAO list. After that, the slides are
  good to train, learn, and remember.

  Second, there's the encode_num nim file that can be used to
  translate a number to a mnemotechnique "story".

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
nim -c -r encode_num.nim
#+END_SRC

to fill the hashes from the org file, here's a very naive way to do it:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

(echo "var people = [ " ; cat pao.org | grep -v "^#"| grep -v "^$"| grep -v "^\* "| range "(($.)%2)" | sed -e 's/\*\*//' -e 's/^/  "/' -e 's/$/",/' ; echo  "]")  >>people.nim
(echo "var actions = [ " ; cat pao.org| grep -v "^#"| grep -v "^$"| grep -v "^\* "| range "(($.+1)%2)" | sed -e 's/\*\*//' -e 's/^/  "/' -e 's/$/",/' ; echo  "]")  >>people.nim

#+END_SRC
